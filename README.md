# web-bug-tracker
Welcome to the BLOX City bug tracker! This repository is designed for users to submit issue reports that contain bugs found on the https://www.bloxcity.com/ website.

## Reporting bugs
When reporting a bug, please ensure it is not on the "do-not-report" list.
You can find that list [here](do-not-report.md).

Report bugs by creating a new issue [here](https://github.com/BLOX-City/web-bug-tracker/issues).

__When creating a report, please follow the template that is auto-filled when you create an issue__

**If the bug is a vulnerability, or major enough to the point of abuse, you are required to email your bug report to us at helpme@bloxcity.com**

Do **NOT** share major vulnerabilities/bugs with ANYONE; this can lead to your account being terminated.

We take these bugs seriously, and we aim to get most bugs squashed within one to two business days after being reported.

## Rewards?
We do not typically offer any type of rewards for reporting bugs, but we occasionally will. This is a case-by-case basis.
